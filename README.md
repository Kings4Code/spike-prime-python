# spike-prime-python
Lego Spike Prime Python programs in .llsp3 format.
Made by FLL Team # The Robokids, Lead coder Kings4Code.
Most of the codes are runs for our robot,
solving the FLL 2023-24 season Masterpiece and the 2024-25 season Submerged.
The rest are all functions such as Gyro Straight and Gyro Turn, that are useful for most FLL seasons.
If your team does end up using or taking inspiration from them, please properly give credit to The Robokids and/or Kings4Code.
